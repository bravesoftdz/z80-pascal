
Language definition (BNF)
=========================

  UnsignedLiteral production is defined as "integer | NIL | String".  This is
  because it is used at expressions.  The problem is this production is used
  also to define Constant, wich is "[+|-]UnsignedLiteral | String".  I think it
  shouldn't be used at Constant as it allows "negative strings" and "negative
  nulls"!!!

  ------------

  Current definition sets an strict order for declarations and definitions
  (constants, variables and functions and procedures) so there's no way to
  (for example) define variables just before the main block after all
  procedures.  For the sake of legibility may be this should be changed
  allowing more flexibility in this order.  An alternative BNF may be:


  DeclarationPart = { ConstDefinitions
                      TypeDefinitions VarDeclarations
                      ProcDeclarations } .
  ...

  ProcDeclarations = [ ( ProcHeading | FuncHeading ) ";" Body ";" ] .

  This production may work but I feel it is not the best way.  That's why I
  didn't added it to the minipas.atg file yet.
