 - Rename unit "Z80Encoders" to "Z80Encoder".  It will implement a generic
   Z80 encoder wich would be (or not) used by other encoders (MSXEncoder,
   Z80Encoder, etc.).  Another generic encoder would be "Z80GBEncoder", as
   GameBoy's microprocessor is a bit different than Z-80.

 - Some Assembler related methods implemented at TZ80Encoder should be moved to
   TPascalEncoder.  Method "ParseASM" should be /final/.  Add an abstract
   method named "ASMStatement" and use it as entry point for the Assembler
   instead of "Z80Statement".

 - Plan variable support:  global, local, parameters, VAR parameters,
   OUT parameters and return value.  Somebody at CEZ forum suggested the use
   of SP to define procedure frames.

 - Implement PROCEDURE and AssignmentOrCall with simple expression.
