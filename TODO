  Helper procedures to get tokens (GetComment, GetIdentifier, etc) don't deal
  with EOF and they should.  Not sure the best way to do that yet (that's why I
  didn't added it yet).



Language definition (BNF)
=========================

  minipas.atg applies some changes to my original description to fix the next
  problems with definition.  First compiler version should test if they're best
  solutions:



  UnsignedLiteral production is defined as "integer | NIL | String".  This is
  because it is used at expressions.  The problem is this production is used
  also to define Constant, wich is "[+|-]UnsignedLiteral | String".  I think it
  shouldn't be used at Constant as it allows "negative strings" and "negative
  nulls"!!!

  ------------

  Test declarations and definitions order (constants, variables and functions
  and procedures).  Current production at minipas.atg may not work.
