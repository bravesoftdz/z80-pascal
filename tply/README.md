The files in this folder are for testing purposes. They implement some basic
lexers and grammars.

test_lexer.y
------------
This is a very simple implementation of a lexer only. The grammar does not do
anything other than generating the tokens. The resulting file will parse each
token from and input file and print them to screen. One can actually use this
and implement manually it's own grammar.
