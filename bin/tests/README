  This directory should contain files to test the compiler.

  Files may not be "programs" in the sense of "useful and example programs".
  They should be files to check that compiler works correctly.  That means the
  files may contain even invalid programs (for example to check if compiler
  shows the appropiate error messages) and useless programs (for ecample to
  check if code generator is able to deal with some special cases).

  All files must be commented explaining what are the compiler functions or
  characteristics to be tested, including the expected results, in the most
  complete way possible.
