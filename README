Introduction
============

  Z80-Pascal aims to create a Pascal compiler for Z-80 based devices, such as
  MSX, ZX, Game Boy and many others.

  This is the first public release of the compiler.  There are a lot of things
  that just don't work at all.

  I'm working on it in my free time, so it evolves sssslooooooowwwwlyyyy.
  Please, don't ask when it will be finished because I have no idea at all.

============
Installation
============

  If you got the binary version, just unzip the package file.  The executable
  files are in the "bin" subdirectory.

  If you got the source code version, you must compile it:

  1.- Be sure you have all you need: Free Pascal compiler and/or Lazarus IDE.
      May be you can use Delphi but I didn't test it.

  2.- Open a console and go to the project directory.  In most cases just use
      "cd project".

  3.- Execute "fix.bat" on Windows or "./fix.sh" on GNU/Linux and follow the on
      screen instructions.

  4.- Execute the "make" command.  This should create the compiler executable.
      Execute "make help" to see all available options.

  5.- For the IDE, open the "z80pide.lpr" file at z80-pascal/src/ide with
      Lazarus, check the project options and the compiler options to be sure
      the directory paths weren't twisted and compile.

  See the docs/internal directory for several documents about internal
  descriptions, including a brief UML description of the objects (You'll need
  GNU's Dia to load this one).

  If you have problems read the "Contact info" section.
